# Pinterest Clone (Personal MERN Stack Project)

Welcome! My name is Ravindra Pawar, and this is my personal project inspired by Pinterest, built to deepen my understanding of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This web application is a hands-on learning journey, where I explored building a full-stack platform from scratch, focusing on user experience, authentication, and scalable image management.

## Why I Built This Project
I wanted to challenge myself by recreating a visually rich, interactive social platform similar to Pinterest. My goals were:
- To master the MERN stack through practical implementation
- To learn secure user authentication and account management
- To handle image uploads, cropping, and cloud storage efficiently
- To design a responsive, modern UI using React and Tailwind CSS
- To implement real-world features like search, comments, likes, and user profiles

## What I Learned
- Building RESTful APIs and connecting frontend to backend
- Managing state with Redux and Redux Thunk
- Implementing authentication (JWT, Google OAuth)
- Handling images and multimedia with cloud storage
- Creating reusable components and layouts in React
- Using modern CSS frameworks for responsive design

## Features
- Visual discovery and image gallery
- Pinning, liking, and commenting on posts
- User profiles with bio, followers, and following
- Secure authentication (signup, login, password reset)
- Google OAuth integration
- Image cropping and upload
- Search functionality for posts and users
- Responsive design for all devices

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, MUI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT, Google OAuth
- **Image Handling:** react-easy-crop, cloud storage
